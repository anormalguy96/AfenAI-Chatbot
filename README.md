   - Contains the styles and design specifications for the project.  
   - Includes layout adjustments, animations, and responsive design principles.

2. **`afenai.html`**

   - Includes event listeners, dynamic content manipulation, and other JavaScript functions.

3. Open `afenai.html` in a web browser to view the interface.

## Development Notes
